# 🛍️ Flask E-Commerce API

This is a **Flask-based E-Commerce API** that provides authentication, product management, and order management functionalities. It integrates with **PostgreSQL** and includes security features such as JWT authentication and rate limiting.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Register and login users securely
  - Password hashing with `werkzeug.security`
  - JWT authentication for secure access

- **Admin Panel**
  - Restricts access to admin users
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)

- **Product Management**
  - Add, update, delete, and fetch products
  - Uses PostgreSQL as the database

- **Order Management**
  - Create, update, delete, and fetch orders
  - Supports linking orders with products

- **Security & Performance**
  - Uses `flask_limiter` for API rate limiting
  - Implements JWT-based authentication
  - Uses `.env` for storing sensitive credentials
